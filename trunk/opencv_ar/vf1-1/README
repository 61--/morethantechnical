Variable focal length solver.

Before use, make sure you read and agree to the terms
and conditions listed in the COPYRIGHT file.

The C++ library is made from the following files:
  vf_solve.cxx         Main routine.
  vf_solve.h
  vf_10_33.cxx         Generated code.
  vf_10_33.h
  vf_eig.cxx           Solves general real eigenproblem.
  vf_eig.h
  vf_qr.cxx            QR reduction with column pivoting.
  vf_qr.h
Call the function vf_solve(); all other functions are internal.
You will need to link against LAPACK (+ BLAS), or to include
the source or object files for DGEEV and DGEQP3 in the library.

There is a very simple test program in testprog.cxx

Compiling with GCC
------------------
Linking to the FORTRAN code can usually be accomplished using
the linker options -llapack -lblas -lg2c.
